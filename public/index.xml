It is said to be especially helpful when studying terms for medical school or in learning different languages, but can be beneficial in all sorts of subjects.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a student who is interested in a few subjects and decided to restart blogging after my last one went down a few years ago.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting information about projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on in writing or code as well as my thoughts on current events, etc.
Overall this is worked on randomly and for fun (hopefully).
Let me know if you have any comments and feel free to email me.</description>
