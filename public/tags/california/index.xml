      <description>San Francisco - Larger and Hillier than I thought Honestly, stepping into San Francisco was surreal.
Until this point, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been into California in my life (even though I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about it from several people), and honestly only had the opportunity to go there for business and a coding conference with some friends/coworkers.
While we were a bit busy during the day time with conferences, we did some touring late night, which may have been a poor choice, but honestly led to a better viewing of San Francisco.</description>
