      <description>How has progress been? Unfortunately, due to being fairly busy with my company, Scintillating, I have not had as much time to work on this project.
However, I have been working on it with my spare time - I will soon reach out to more people/the community to see if anyone is truly interested before delving deeper into graphics development.
Creating the actual functionality in Java is not too terribly difficult, and I have made good progress.</description>

      <description>What is Silenda? When I was initially thinking about a new project to build for fun, which would be a welcome break from the work that I do and the other projects that I have already started, I was a bit stumped on how to proceed.
I saw a ton of idea generators and other such things, but ultimately doubled down on something I could use myself. My friends and I play a ton of card games as I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of those reading right now do.</description>
