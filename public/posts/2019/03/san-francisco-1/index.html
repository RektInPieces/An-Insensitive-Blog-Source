<h2 id="larger-and-hillier-than-i-thought">Larger and Hillier than I thought</h2>

<p>Yeah, this is a little bit late (~6 months after? I mean, I totally started this the day after I got back, but y&rsquo;know). Still, to be entirely honest, stepping into San Francisco was a bit surreal. The busy streets were way too steep, and I felt as if I tripped on one of them, then I would go rolling down for miles with only a few trucks to stop me.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/Travel/California/SanFrancisco/Pic_2019_07_13_23_41_00.jpg" alt="steep road" /></p>

<p>Until this point, I hadn&rsquo;t been into California in my life (even though I&rsquo;ve heard about it from several people), and honestly only had the opportunity to go there for business and a coding conference with some friends/coworkers.</p>

<p>While we were a bit busy during the day time with conferences, we did some touring late night, which may have been a poor choice, but honestly led to a better viewing of San Francisco.</p>

<h2 id="so-where-d-we-even-go-first">So, where&rsquo;d we even go first</h2>

<p>As all &ldquo;good&rdquo; tourists do, we went down to the fisherman&rsquo;s wharf first. Our motivation was primarily Krispy Kreme donuts, but as we ran across the streets separating Tenderloin and the Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, we weren&rsquo;t able to reach there on time that night (though we later did, and they were quite possibly better than Dunkin Donuts).</p>

<p>So instead, we settled for In N Out, where I could literally only eat fries (I did eat around 3 orders of them though, don&rsquo;t blame me potatoes are great ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯).</p>

<p>After that, we just roamed around the wharf in the night. It was pretty interesting to hear seals, but I didn&rsquo;t really see them that night (note: I later saw them in the morning, but failed to take a picture).</p>

<p>We looked through some souvenir shops before doing something I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend: roaming San Francisco by ourselves after midnight.</p>

<h2 id="uh-why-not">Uh, why not?</h2>

<p>Well, we were definitely inexperienced with San Fran, and also under the age of 18. The idea of roaming by ourselves may have felt great, but in practice, was a lot less intelligent than we thought.</p>

<p>We ran through the streets of SF, and through random chance, arrived at the Coit Tower in the middle of the night.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/Travel/California/SanFrancisco/Pic_2019_07_13_23_33_36.jpg" alt="Coit" /></p>

<p>Although we couldn&rsquo;t enter at that hour, we still got a very good view of San Francisco, which I would have taken a picture of, if not for the worried voice of my friend killing the mood. I still remember exactly what he said, &ldquo;hey, I think there&rsquo;s some things growling over there&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;really? That&rsquo;s what happens? We encountered a pack of particularly brave coyotes on the top of the hill. Who knows how they got there, but we didn&rsquo;t really stick around long enough to find out.</p>

<p>We ran down the step</p>
