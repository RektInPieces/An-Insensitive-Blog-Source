## About
Hey there! I am a student who is interested in a few subjects, including technology, coding, writing and politics. I've been wanting to restart blogging after my last one went down a few years ago, but have been procrastinating a lot instead.

I’ll be posting information about projects I’m working on and my opinions on current events.

Overall, this is worked on randomly and for enjoyment, so updates may be infrequent.

Let me know if you have any comments and feel free to email me.
