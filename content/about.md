I'm a student who is interested in a few subjects and decided to restart blogging after my last one went down a few years ago.

I'll be posting information about projects I'm working on in writing or code as well as my thoughts on current events, etc.

Overall this is worked on randomly and for fun (hopefully).

Let me know if you have any comments and feel free to email me.
