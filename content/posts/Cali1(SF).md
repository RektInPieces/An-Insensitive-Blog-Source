## San Francisco - Larger and Hillier than I thought

Yeah, this is a little bit late (~6 months after? I mean, I totally started this the day after I got back, but y'know). Still, to be entirely honest, stepping into San Francisco was a bit surreal.

We looked through some souvenier shops before doing something I wouldn't recommend: roaming San Francisco by ourselves after midnight.
