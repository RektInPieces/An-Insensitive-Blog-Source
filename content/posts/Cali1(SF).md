##  Larger and Hillier than I thought

Yeah, this is a little bit late (~6 months after? I mean, I totally started this the day after I got back, but y'know). Still, to be entirely honest, stepping into San Francisco was a bit surreal. The busy streets were way too steep, and I felt as if I tripped on one of them, then I would go rolling down for miles with only a few trucks to stop me.

Until this point, I hadn't been into California in my life (even though I've heard about it from several people), and honestly only had the opportunity to go there for business and a coding conference with some friends/coworkers.

While we were a bit busy during the day time with conferences, we did some touring late night, which may have been a poor choice, but honestly led to a better viewing of San Francisco.

## So, where'd we even go first

As all "good" tourists do, we went down to the fisherman's wharf first. Our motivation was primarily Krispy Kreme donuts, but as we ran across the streets separating Tenderloin and the Fisherman's Wharf, we weren't able to reach there on time that night (though we later did, and they were quite possibly better than Dunkin Donuts).

So instead, we settled for In N Out, where I could literally only eat fries (I did eat around 3 orders of them though, don't blame me potatoes are great ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).

After that, we just roamed around the wharf in the night. It was pretty interesting to hear seals, but I didn't really see them that night (note: I later saw them in the morning, but failed to take a picture).

We looked through some souvenir shops before doing something I wouldn't recommend: roaming San Francisco by ourselves after midnight. 

## Uh, why not?

Well, we were definitely inexperienced with San Fran, and also under the age of 18. The idea of roaming by ourselves may have felt great, but in practice, was a lot less intelligent than we thought. 

We ran through the streets of SF, and through random chance, arrived at the Coit Tower in the middle of the night.

Although we couldn't enter at that hour, we still got a very good view of San Francisco, which I would have taken a picture of, if not for the worried voice of my friend killing the mood. I still remember exactly what he said, "hey, I think there's something that is growling over there...?"

...uhhhh? To be honest, I don't even know how that could happen. We encountered a pack of particularly brave coyotes on the top of the hill. Who knows how they got there, but we didn't  stick around long enough to find out. 

We ran down the steps, not really stopping to look back. We didn't really keep in mind how loud our footsteps and shouts were until we were mostly in the all the way down through the surrounding, gated neighborhood. 

Yet, we kept on running (at one point running into a tenant of the surrounding area, who got equally spooked by the possibility of coyotes and ran back inside his house).

Through possibly sheer luck, we ended up in Chinatown.
