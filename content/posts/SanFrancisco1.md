## San Francisco - Larger and Hillier than I thought

Honestly, stepping into San Francisco was surreal. 

Until this point, I hadn't been into California in my life (even though I've heard about it from several people), and honestly only had the opportunity to go there for business and a coding conference with some friends/coworkers.

While we were a bit busy during the day time with conferences, we did some touring late night, which may have been a poor choice, but honestly led to a better viewing of San Francisco.
