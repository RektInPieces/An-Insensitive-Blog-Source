## Two posts in one day!?!?

Yeah, I know.

## New name?

Yeah, we came up with a name for the project we are working (by we, I mean with my friend at [his blog](https://potatofrom.space).

It's a play on the words "Knowledge" and "Everything" or "Know Everything," which eventually translates to "Knoweth". The application enables someone to easily, and in a scheduled manner, be able to memorize large pieces of information for a continued time period.

To build the application, we are using TeaVM, and overview of how it's implemented can be found [here](https://potatofrom.space/post/knoweth-teavm-first-look/).

I have a bit more to add, but I'd like to release a huge mega-dump of development updates, which will probably end up being published sometime next week.

As always, let me know if there are any questions, and I'll be back next week!
